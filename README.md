# Coding Challenge

Create an HTML5, CSS3 layout page (wireframe below). You can use placeholder text in the content areas (e.g. lorem ipsum). 

Create a search component with a search icon that expands when you click on it for you to enter the search text and collapses when you click on the icon again.

Upon pressing enter while the cursor is in the search field, execute a search against a local JSON file, read the results and display them just below the search input. Make sure the results are sorted (alphabetized) before displaying them.  The search results can be displayed in a drawer underneath the search input.  

The data returned by the search can be anything you want. A list of your favorite movies? Places you’ve visited on vacation? Get creative.

You can use any frameworks or libraries you wish, however we’d like to see a base of jQuery and the search logic coded by hand and not provided by a plugin. Want to show off some JavaScript MV* or JavaScript Unit Tests? That’s awesome and extra credit will be given. 

Place your search component in the below layout.  The layout should be fluid and responsive.  It should also work well across all modern browsers.  An email address is required to sign up for a newsletter.  The newsletter sign up form submission does not need to go anywhere.
